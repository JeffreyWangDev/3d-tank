## Day one
**5 hours**

I designed the mounting for the motor along with the 90* bend for the MOD gears. Along with this, I designed the frame and everything that attaches to it. I thought about using a laser-cut wood/plastic sheet for the body, but decided that it won't be the best due to being flimsy.

## Day two
**8 hours**

Today I designed the tracks and the cogs that went on the track. Additionally, I spent a considerable amount of time redesigning the body because I had overlooked including tolerances in the original design. Also spent a bunch of time putting everything together in the CAD with all the screws and COTS parts.
